Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production.\n","\n","History\n","Early history\n","The spice trade developed throughout the Indian subcontinent by at earliest 2000 BCE with cinnamon and black pepper, and in East Asia with herbs and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for mummification and their demand for exotic spices and herbs helped stimulate world trade. The word spice comes from the Old French word espice, which became epice, and which came from the Latin root spec, the noun referring to \"appearance, sort, kind\": species has the same root. By 1000 BCE, medical systems based upon herbs could be found in China, Korea, and India. Early uses were connected with magic, medicine, religion, tradition, and preservation.Cloves were used in Mesopotamia by 1700 BCE. The ancient Indian epic Ramayana mentions cloves. The Romans had cloves in the 1st century CE, as Pliny the Elder wrote about them.The earliest written records of spices come from ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian cultures. The Ebers Papyrus from early Egypt dating from 1550 B.C.E. describes some eight hundred different medicinal remedies and numerous medicinal procedures.Historians believe that nutmeg, which originates from the Banda Islands in Southeast Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 6th century BCE.Indonesian merchants traveled around China, India, the Middle East, and the east coast of Africa. Arab merchants facilitated the routes through the Middle East and India. This resulted in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria being the main trading center for spices. The most important discovery prior to the European spice trade was the monsoon winds (40 CE). Sailing from Eastern spice cultivators to Western European consumers gradually replaced the land-locked spice routes once facilitated by the Middle East Arab caravans.In the story of Genesis, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice merchants. In the biblical poem Song of Solomon, the male speaker compares his beloved to many forms of spices.\n","\n","Middle Ages\n","Spices were among the most demanded and expensive products available in Europe in the Middle Ages,[5] the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Given medieval medicine's main theory of humorism, spices and herbs were indispensable to balance \"humors\" in food,[6] a daily basis for good health at a time of recurrent pandemics. In addition to being desired by those using medieval medicine, the European elite also craved spices in the Middle Ages. An example of the European aristocracy's demand for spice comes from the King of Aragon, who invested substantial resources into bringing back spices to Spain in the 12th century. He was specifically looking for spices to put in wine, and was not alone among European monarchs at the time to have such a desire for spice.Spices were all imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them expensive. From the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice had the monopoly on spice trade with the Middle East, and along with it the neighboring Italian maritime republics and city-states. The trade made the region rich. It has been estimated that around 1,000  tons of pepper and 1,000  tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the Late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. The most exclusive was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen into obscurity in European cuisine include grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which mostly replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb.\n","\n","Early Modern Period\n","Spain and Portugal were interested in seeking new routes to trade in spices and other valuable products from Asia. The control of trade routes and the spice-producing regions were the main reasons that Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama sailed to India in 1499.[8] When da Gama discovered the pepper market in India, he was able to secure peppers for a much cheaper price than the ones demanded by Venice. At around the same time, Christopher Columbus returned from the New World.  He described to investors new spices available there.Another source of competition in the spice trade during the 15th and 16th century was the Ragusans from the maritime republic of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia.The military prowess of Afonso de Albuquerque (1453–1515) allowed the Portuguese to take control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he took the island of Socotra in the mouth of the Red Sea and, in 1507, Ormuz in the Persian Gulf. Since becoming the viceroy of the Indies, he took Goa in India in 1510, and Malacca on the Malay peninsula in 1511. The Portuguese could now trade directly with Siam, China, and the Maluku Islands.\n","With the discovery of the New World came new spices, including allspice, chili peppers, vanilla, and chocolate. This development kept the spice trade, with America as a latecomer with its new seasonings, profitable well into the 19th century.\n","\n","Function\n","Spices are primarily used as food flavoring. They are also used to perfume cosmetics and incense. At various periods, many spices have been believed to have medicinal value. Finally, since they are expensive, rare, and exotic commodities, their conspicuous consumption has often been a symbol of wealth and social class.\n","\n","It is often claimed that spices were used either as food preservatives or to mask the taste of spoiled meat, especially in the Middle Ages. This is false. In fact, spices are rather ineffective as preservatives as compared to salting, smoking, pickling, or drying, and are ineffective in covering the taste of spoiled meat. Moreover, spices have always been comparatively expensive: in 15th century Oxford, a whole pig cost about the same as a pound of the cheapest spice, pepper. There is also no evidence of such use from contemporary cookbooks: \"Old cookbooks make it clear that spices weren't used as a preservative. They typically suggest adding spices toward the end of the cooking process, where they could have no preservative effect whatsoever.\" In fact, Cristoforo di Messisbugo suggested in the 16th century that pepper may speed up spoilage.Though some spices have antimicrobial properties in vitro, pepper—by far the most common spice—is relatively ineffective, and in any case, salt, which is far cheaper, is also far more effective.\n","\n","Classification and types\n","Culinary herbs and spices\n","Botanical basis\n","Common spice mixtures\n","Handling\n","A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as ginger, is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example turmeric, and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.\n","\n","For ground spices, to grind a whole spice, the classic tool is mortar and pestle. Less labor-intensive tools are more common now:  a microplane or fine grater can be used to grind small amounts; a coffee grinder is useful for larger amounts. A frequently used spice such as black pepper may merit storage in its own hand grinder or mill.\n","The flavor of a spice is derived in part from compounds (volatile oils) that oxidize or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a spice greatly increases its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation. Thus, the flavor is maximized by storing a spice whole and grinding when needed. The shelf life of a whole dry spice is roughly two years; of a ground spice roughly six months. The \"flavor life\" of a ground spice can be much shorter. Ground spices are better stored away from light.Some flavor elements in spices are soluble in water; many are soluble in oil or fat. As a general rule, the flavors from a spice take time to infuse into the food so spices are added early in preparation. This contrasts to herbs which are usually added late in preparation.\n","\n","Salmonella contamination\n","A study by the Food and Drug Administration of shipments of spices to the United States during fiscal years 2007-2009 showed about 7% of the shipments were contaminated by Salmonella bacteria, some of it antibiotic-resistant. As most spices are cooked before being served salmonella contamination often has no effect, but some spices, particularly pepper, are often eaten raw and present at table for convenient use. Shipments from Mexico and India, a major producer, were the most frequently contaminated. However, with newly developed radiation sterilization methods, the risk of Salmonella contamination is now lower.\n","\n","Nutrition\n","Because they tend to have strong flavors and are used in small quantities, spices tend to add few calories to food, even though many spices, especially those made from seeds, contain high portions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate by weight. However, when used in larger quantity, spices can also contribute a substantial amount of minerals and other micronutrients, including iron, magnesium, calcium, and many others, to the diet. For example, a teaspoon of paprika contains about 1133 IU of Vitamin A, which is over 20% of the recommended daily allowance specified by the US FDA.Most herbs and spices have substantial antioxidant activity, owing primarily to phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, which influence nutrition through many pathways, including affecting the absorption of other nutrients. One study found cumin and fresh ginger to be highest in antioxidant activity.\n","\n","Production\n","India contributes 75% of global spice production.\n","\n","Standardization\n","The International Organization for Standardization addresses spices and condiments, along with related food additives, as part of the International Classification for Standards 67.220 series.\n","\n","Research\n","The Indian Institute of Spices Research in Kozhikode, Kerala, is devoted exclusively to conducting research for ten spice crops: black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, garcinia, ginger, nutmeg, paprika, turmeric, and vanilla.\n","\n","Gallery\n","See also\n","List of Indian spices – Variety of spices grown across the Indian subcontinent\n","List of culinary herbs and spices\n","Outline of herbs and spices\n","Seasoning – Process of imparting flavor to or improving the flavor of food\n","Spice mix\n","Spice use in Antiquity\n","\n","Notes\n","References\n","Further reading\n","Books\n","Czarra, Fred (2009).

One study found cumin and fresh ginger to be highest in antioxidant activity.\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: Production (1):\n","India contributes 75% of global spice production.\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: Standardization (1):\n","The International Organization for Standardization addresses spices and condiments, along with related food additives, as part of the International Classification for Standards 67.220 series.\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: Research (1):\n","The Indian Institute of Spices Research in Kozhikode, Kerala, is devoted exclusively to conducting research for ten spice crops: black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, garcinia, ginger, nutmeg, paprika, turmeric, and vanilla.\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: Gallery (1):\n","\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: See also (1):\n","List of Indian spices – Variety of spices grown across the Indian subcontinent\n","List of culinary herbs and spices\n","Outline of herbs and spices\n","Seasoning – Process of imparting flavor to or improving the flavor of food\n","Spice mix\n","Spice use in Antiquity\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: Notes (1):\n","\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: References (1):\n","\n","Subsections (0):\n",", Section: Further reading (1):\n","\n","Subsections (2):\n","Section: Books (2):\n","Czarra, Fred (2009).

It's a herbaceous perennial that produces leafy stems 1–2 meters tall from rhizomatous roots. The alternately-arranged leaves are dark green, 10–30 cm long and 2.5–6 cm across, elliptical to oblong in shape. Pink flowers are borne near the ground and give way to red, fleshy fruits containing shiny brown seeds, which are typically 3–5 mm in diameter.The spice, known as Ethiopian cardamom, false cardamom, or korarima, is obtained from the plant's seeds (usually dried), and is extensively used in Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine.  It is an ingredient in berbere, mitmita, awaze, and other spice mixtures, and is also used to flavor coffee. Its flavor is comparable to that of the closely related Elettaria cardamomum or green cardamom. In Ethiopian herbal medicine, the seeds are used as a tonic, carminative, and laxative.The plant is native to Tanzania, western Ethiopia (in the vicinity of Lake Tana and Gelemso), southwestern Sudan, western Uganda. It is cultivated in both Ethiopia and Eritrea, although the fruits are typically harvested from wild plants.

Therefore, it has potential applications as not only a spice in food preparation, but also in the medical field as a treatment option for microbial infection.

The leaves are ovate or elliptic, 4–7 cm long, and the flowers star-shaped in appearance.Backhousia Myrtifolia is renowned for the snow-white colour of its flowers, a characteristic that makes it suitable not only as a domestic/commercial crop but also as an internationally exported product.

In the Guatemalan municipality of Todos Santos Cuchumatán it is called tzchiquin itz in the Mam language.  It is called muc' by the Qʼeqchiʼ in the area of Cobán.The plant grows as a tree or small shrub with distichous, subsessile, oblanceolate leaves.  It has solitary flowers borne on long slender peduncles coming from the internodes of the smaller branches.  Its sepals are broadly ovate or suborbicular, cuspidate, reflexed at length,  The outer petals are similar, but are much larger than the sepals. The inner petals are thick and fleshy with an involute margin that causes them to resemble a human ear.  When fresh, the pungent flowers are greenish-yellow with the inner surface of the inner petals tending towards orange, at length turning brownish-purple or maroon, breaking with a bright orange fracture.The dried flowers of C. penduliflorum and related species C. costaricense were traditionally used to give a spicy flavor to chocolate before the arrival of cinnamon and the other Old World spices.  The dried petals are still used to in atoles, pinoles, and coffee.It is native to mountainous areas of southern Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador.  It is still cultivated as a spice in the Guatemalan regions around Cobán and Jacaltenango and sold in markets in those areas as well as Antigua Guatemala, Santa Ana, El Salvador, and San Andrés Tuxtla, Mexico.\n","\n","\n","== References ==</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row60\" class=\"row_heading level0 row60\" >60</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row60_col0\" class=\"data row60 col0\" >Dalea lasiathera</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row60_col1\" class=\"data row60 col1\" >Dalea lasiathera (common name purple prairieclover), is a plant from the Southwestern United States.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row61\" class=\"row_heading level0 row61\" >61</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row61_col0\" class=\"data row61 col0\" >Dill</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row61_col1\" class=\"data row61 col1\" >Dill (Anethum graveolens) is an annual herb in the celery family Apiaceae.

The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots.Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste. In 2018, world production of ginger was 2.8 million tonnes, led by India with 32% of the world total.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row83\" class=\"row_heading level0 row83\" >83</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row83_col0\" class=\"data row83 col0\" >Grains of Selim</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row83_col1\" class=\"data row83 col1\" >Grains of Selim are the seeds of a shrubby tree, Xylopia aethiopica, found in Africa.

This is done to balance out the candy-like sweetness of Fee's and the heavy cardamom note of Regans'.Orange bitters can also be made at home, allowing one to create new flavor profiles that are not available anywhere else.

Pink peppercorns came to be called such because they resemble peppercorns, and because they, too, have a peppery flavor.  As they are members of the cashew family, they may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis for people with a tree nut allergy.Dried berries from the related species Schinus terebinthifolia (the Brazilian pepper), are sometimes also called pink peppercorns (baies roses de Bourbon) and are used as a culinary spice. The Brazilian pepper was introduced as an ornamental plant to Florida by at latest 1891, probably earlier, where it has spread rapidly since about 1940, and eventually became invasive in the area where it is often referred to as \"Florida Holly\".\n","In 1982, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the import of Brazilian peppercorns from France into the United States, asserting that people who eat the berries risk an array of acute symptoms, such as swollen eyelids and indigestion, similar to poison ivy. In response, the Government of France maintained that the berries are safe to eat if grown in prescribed conditions. The United States later lifted the ban. The fruit and leaves of Peruvian pepper are potentially poisonous to poultry, pigs and possibly calves. Records also exist of young children who have experienced vomiting and diarrhea after eating the fruit.

Commercial cubeb consists of the dried berries, similar in appearance to black pepper, but with stalks attached – the \"tails\" in \"tailed pepper\".  The dried pericarp is wrinkled, and its color ranges from grayish brown to black. The seed is hard, white and oily. The odor of cubeb is described as agreeable and aromatic and the taste as pungent, acrid, slightly bitter and persistent.  It has been described as tasting like allspice, or like a cross between allspice and black pepper.\n","Cubeb came to Europe via India through the trade with the Arabs. The name cubeb comes from Arabic kabāba (كبابة‎) by way of Old French quibibes. Cubeb is mentioned in alchemical writings by its Arabic name. In his Theatrum Botanicum, John Parkinson tells that the king of Portugal prohibited the sale of cubeb to promote black pepper (Piper nigrum) around 1640. It experienced a brief resurgence in 19th-century Europe for medicinal uses, but has practically vanished from the European market since. It continues to be used as a flavoring agent for gins and cigarettes in the West, and as a seasoning for food in Indonesia.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row123\" class=\"row_heading level0 row123\" >123</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row123_col0\" class=\"data row123 col0\" >Piper excelsum</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row123_col1\" class=\"data row123 col1\" >Piper excelsum (formerly known as Macropiper excelsum), commonly known as kawakawa, is a small tree of which the subspecies P. excelsum subsp. excelsum is endemic to New Zealand; the subspecies P. e. subsp. psittacorum is found on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and the Kermadec Islands.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row124\" class=\"row_heading level0 row124\" >124</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row124_col0\" class=\"data row124 col0\" >Piper guineense</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row124_col1\" class=\"data row124 col1\" >Piper guineense is a West African species of Piper; the spice derived from its dried fruit is known as Ashanti pepper, Benin pepper, Edo pepper, false cubeb, Guinea cubeb, and called locally kale, kukauabe, masoro, etiñkeni, sasema, soro wisa, eyendo, eshasha'by the Urhobo people, oziza and uziza.  It is a close relative of cubeb pepper and a relative of black pepper and long pepper. Unlike cubeb, which is large and spherical in shape, Ashanti pepper grains are prolate spheroids, smaller and smoother than Cubeb pepper in appearance and generally bear a reddish tinge. The stalks of Ashanti pepper berries are also distinctly curved whilst those of cubeb pepper are completely straight. The terms West African pepper and Guinea pepper have also been used, but are ambiguous and may refer to grains of Selim or grains of paradise.\n","The plants that provide Ashanti pepper are vines that can grow up to 20 m in length, climbing up boles of trees by means of adventitious roots. These are native to topical regions of Central and Western Africa and are semi-cultivated in countries such as Nigeria where the leaves, known as uziza, are used as a flavouring for stews. Like other members of the pepper family, Ashanti pepper contains 5–8% of the chemical piperine which gives them their piquant taste.  They contain large amounts of beta-caryophyllene, which is being investigated as an anti-inflammatory agent. It also contains significant proportions (up to around 10%) of myristicin, elemicin, safrole, and dillapiol, as well as some apiole (around 1.4%).In terms of flavour, Ashanti pepper is very similar to cubeb pepper but is less bitter and has a fresher, more herbaceous flavour and aroma than cubeb's more pine-like scent.  Though known in Europe during the Middle Ages (it was a common spice in Rouen and Dieppe in 14th-century France), these days, its use is largely marginalized to West and Central Africa.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row125\" class=\"row_heading level0 row125\" >125</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row125_col0\" class=\"data row125 col0\" >Pistacia lentiscus</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row125_col1\" class=\"data row125 col1\" >Pistacia lentiscus (also lentisk; mastic; Greek: μαστίχα mastíkha; Turkish: damla sakızı) is a dioecious evergreen shrub or small tree of the genus Pistacia, growing up to 4 m (13 ft) tall which is cultivated for its aromatic resin, mainly on the Greek island of Chios.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row126\" class=\"row_heading level0 row126\" >126</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row126_col0\" class=\"data row126 col0\" >Poppy seed</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row126_col1\" class=\"data row126 col1\" >Poppy seed is an oilseed obtained from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum).

The saffron crocus is unknown in the wild; its most likely precursor, Crocus cartwrightianus, originated in Crete or Central Asia; The saffron crocus is native to Southwest Asia and was first cultivated in what is now Greece.From ancient to modern times the history of saffron is full of applications in food, drink, and traditional herbal medicine: from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas the brilliant red threads were—and are—prized in baking, curries, and liquor. It coloured textiles and other items and often helped confer the social standing of political elites and religious adepts. Ancient and medieval peoples believed saffron could be used to treat a wide range of ailments, from stomach upsets to the plague.\n","\n","\"Saffron, for example, was once less regarded than it is today because the crocus from which it is extracted was not particularly mysterious. It flourished in European locations extending from Asia Minor, where it originated, to Saffron Walden in England, where it was naturalised. Only subsequently, when its labour-intensive cultivation became largely centred in Kashmir, did it seem sufficiently exotic to qualify as one of the most precious of spices.\"Saffron crocus cultivation has long centered on a broad belt of Eurasia bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the southwest to India and China in the northeast. The major producers of antiquity—Iran, Spain, India, and Greece—continue to dominate the world trade.\n","The cultivation of saffron in the Americas was begun by members of the Schwenkfelder Church in Pennsylvania. In recent decades cultivation has spread to New Zealand, Tasmania, and California. Iran has accounted for around 90–93 percent of recent annual world production and thereby dominates the export market on a by-quantity basis.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row133\" class=\"row_heading level0 row133\" >133</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row133_col0\" class=\"data row133 col0\" >Saigon cinnamon</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row133_col1\" class=\"data row133 col1\" >Saigon cinnamon (Cinnamomum loureiroi, also known as Vietnamese cinnamon or Vietnamese cassia and quế trà my, quế thanh, or \" quế trà bồng\" in Vietnam) is an evergreen tree indigenous to mainland Southeast Asia.

They dry on the bush and look like raisins. These fruits have a strong, pungent taste of tamarillo and caramel that makes them popular for use in sauces and condiments. They can be obtained either whole or ground, with the ground product (sold as \"kutjera powder\") easily added to bread mixes, salads, sauces, cheese dishes, chutneys, stews or mixed into butter.\n","Martu people would skewer bush tomatoes and dry them so the food was readily transportable.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row146\" class=\"row_heading level0 row146\" >146</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row146_col0\" class=\"data row146 col0\" >Solo garlic</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row146_col1\" class=\"data row146 col1\" >Solo garlic, also known as single clove garlic, monobulb garlic, single bulb garlic, or pearl garlic, is a type of Allium sativum (garlic).

Spices such as cinnamon, cassia, cardamom, ginger, pepper, nutmeg, star anise, clove and turmeric were known and used in antiquity and traded in the Eastern World. These spices found their way into the Near East before the beginning of the Christian era, where the true sources of these spices were withheld by the traders and associated with fantastic tales.The  aspect of the trade was dominated by the Austronesian peoples in Southeast Asia who established the precursor trade routes from Southeast Asia (and later China) to Sri Lanka and India by at least 1500 BC. These goods were then transported by land towards the Mediterranean and the Greco-Roman world via the incense route and the Roman–India routes by Indian and Persian traders. The Austronesian maritime trade lanes later expanded into the Middle East and eastern Africa by the 1st millennium AD, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar.\n","Within specific regions, the Kingdom of Axum (5th century BC–AD 11th century) had pioneered the Red Sea route before the 1st century AD. During the first millennium AD, Ethiopians became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea. By this period, trade routes from Sri Lanka (the Roman Taprobane) and India were also largely controlled by Tamils who had acquired maritime technology from early Austronesian contact. By mid-7th century AD, after the rise of Islam, Arab traders started plying these maritime routes and dominated the western Indian Ocean maritime routes.\n","Arab traders eventually took over conveying goods via the Levant and Venetian merchants to Europe until the rise of the Seljuk Turks and later the Ottoman Turks held the route again by 1090 and 1453 respectively. Overland routes helped the spice trade initially, but maritime trade routes led to tremendous growth in commercial activities to Europe.\n","The trade was changed by the Crusades and later the European Age of Discovery, during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper, became an influential activity for European traders. From the 11th to the 15th centuries, the Italian maritime republics of Venice and Genoa monopolized the trade between Europe and Asia. The Cape Route from Europe to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope was pioneered by the Portuguese explorer navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, resulting in new maritime routes for trade.This trade, which drove the world economy from the end of the Middle Ages well into the Renaissance, ushered in an age of European domination in the East. Channels such as the Bay of Bengal served as bridges for cultural and commercial exchanges between diverse cultures as nations struggled to gain control of the trade along the many spice routes. In 1571 the Spanish opened the first trans-Pacific route between its territories of Philippines and Mexico, served by the Manila Galleon, which lasted until 1815. The Portuguese trade routes were mainly restricted and limited by the use of ancient routes, ports, and nations that were difficult to dominate. The Dutch were later able to bypass many of these problems by pioneering a direct ocean route from the Cape of Good Hope to the Sunda Strait in Indonesia.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row148\" class=\"row_heading level0 row148\" >148</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row148_col0\" class=\"data row148 col0\" >The Spice Trail</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row148_col1\" class=\"data row148 col1\" >The Spice Trail is a British television documentary series first broadcast on BBC Two in 2011 looking at the discovery and history of spices.

The peppers go through a two-part process, where they are sun-dried during the day and wrapped tightly at night. The night process is called 'sweating', and works to infuse the dried flesh with the remaining moisture of the pepper. The result is an appearance ranging from deep purple to a dark, purplish black. Urfa biber is less spicy than many other chili peppers, but provides a more lasting build of heat.\n","The pungency of the urfa biber is 30,000–50,000 SHU on the Scoville scale.It is traditionally used in Turkey in meat and savoury foods.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row161\" class=\"row_heading level0 row161\" >161</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row161_col0\" class=\"data row161 col0\" >Uzazi</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row161_col1\" class=\"data row161 col1\" >The term Uzazi refers to the dried fruit of the West African deciduous shrub Zanthoxylum gilletii, syn.

However, unlike Sichuan pepper where only the pericarp of the fruit is used, uzazi is used whole (both pericarp and seed).

The word vanilla, derived from vainilla, the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod), is translated simply as \"little pod\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlīlxochitl by the Aztecs.\n","Pollination is required to make the plants produce the fruit from which the vanilla spice is obtained. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old enslaved child who lived on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant. Noted French botanist and plant collector Jean Michel Claude Richard falsely claimed to have discovered the technique three or four years earlier. By the end of the 20th century, Albius was considered the true discoverer.\n","Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally, all of which derive from a species originally found in Mesoamerica, including parts of modern-day Mexico. They are V. planifolia (syn. V. fragrans), grown on Madagascar, Réunion, and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean; V. tahitensis, grown in the South Pacific; and V. pompona, found in the West Indies, Central America, and South America. The majority of the world's vanilla is the V. planifolia species, more commonly known as Bourbon vanilla (after the former name of Réunion, Île Bourbon) or Madagascar vanilla, which is produced in Madagascar and neighboring islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and in Indonesia. Madagascar's and Indonesia's cultivations produce two-thirds of the world's supply of vanilla.\n","Vanilla is the second-most expensive spice after saffron because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive. Nevertheless, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume production, and aromatherapy.</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                        <th id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002level0_row163\" class=\"row_heading level0 row163\" >163</th>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row163_col0\" class=\"data row163 col0\" >Wasabi</td>\n","                        <td id=\"T_895117b6_4de4_11ec_bb44_0242ac1c0002row163_col1\" class=\"data row163 col1\" >Wasabi (Japanese: ワサビ, わさび, or 山葵, pronounced [ɰaꜜsabi]; Eutrema japonicum or Wasabia japonica) or Japanese horseradish is a plant of the family Brassicaceae, which also includes horseradish and mustard in other genera.

It is similar in taste to hot mustard or horseradish rather than chili peppers in that it stimulates the nose more than the tongue.

The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E. japonicum 'Daruma' and 'Mazuma', but there are many others.\n","The oldest record of wasabi as a food dates to the 8th century AD. The popularity of wasabi in English-speaking countries has coincided with that of sushi, growing steadily starting in about 1980.Due to issues that limit the Japanese wasabi plant's mass cultivation and thus increase its price and decreased availability outside Japan, the western horseradish plant is generally used in place of the Japanese horseradish.
